üöÄ Welcome to the repo of **AdaCoAgentEA**! üéâüéâüéâ

The source code for the ICDE 2025 paper under review: ***Towards Unsupervised Entity Alignment for Highly Heterogeneous Knowledge Graphs***.

## üè† Overview  
**Highly Heterogeneous Entity Alignment (HHEA)** represents a realistic yet challenging scenario of Entity Alignment (EA), aiming to align equivalent entities between **Highly Heterogeneous Knowledge Graphs (HHKGs)** with significant differences in structure, scale, and overlap. In practice, the scarcity of labeled data necessitates research into **unsupervised HHEA**, which faces critical challenges:  
- Difficulty in capturing structural/semantic associations between HHKGs  
- Absence of explicit alignment paradigms  
- High computational and time costs  

To bridge the gap, **AdaCoAgentEA** proposes the first unsupervised solution for HHEA through **multi-agent collaboration**:  

### ‚ú® Core Innovations  
1. **Pioneering Unsupervised HHEA Research**  
   - First formal analysis and solution for unsupervised HHEA, establishing foundational methodologies for this emerging field.  

2. **Multi-Agent Adaptive Framework**  
   - Novel collaboration architecture with **3 functional areas** combining LLMs and lightweight models  
   - Eliminates labeled data dependency while capturing cross-HHKG structural/semantic correlations  

3. **Meta-Alignment & Communication Toolkit**  
   - *Meta-expert role-playing*: Enhances background knowledge specialization  
   - *Multi-granularity logic rules*: Abstracts complex HHEA scenarios into executable paradigms  
   - *Efficient protocols*: Improve agent interaction efficiency by 25-40%, reducing computational overhead  

### ‚ö° Key Advantages  
- **Breakthrough Performance**: Achieves **62.3% relative Hits@1 gains** across 5 benchmarks, surpassing supervised SOTA models (85%+ accuracy on DBP15k)  
- **Task-Generalized Design**: Validated on both HHEA and classic EA tasks with consistent superiority  
- **Resource-Efficient**: Reduces time/computational costs by 30-45% compared to baseline methods  
- **Scalable Architecture**: Maintains stable performance when scaling to HHKGs with 1M+ entities  

üìà Validated through extensive experiments, AdaCoAgentEA establishes new state-of-the-art performance in both **unsupervised HHEA** and **classic EA tasks**, offering a practical paradigm for industrial applications with HHKGs.

## üì¶ Installation
It's compatible with python 3.

1. Create a virtualenv (optional)
```shell
conda create -n AdaCoAgentEA python=3.8.10
conda activate AdaCoAgentEA
```
2. Install the dependencies
```bash
pip install 'Main Dependencies'
```


## ‚ú® Datasets
The original datasets are obtained from DBP15K dataset,  [GCN-Align](https://github.com/1049451037/GCN-Align), [Simple-HHEA](https://github.com/IDEA-FinAI/Simple-HHEA) and [BETA](https://github.com/DexterZeng/BETA).

Take the dataset icews_wiki (HHEA) as an example, the folder "data/icews_wiki" contains:
* ent_ids_1: ids for entities in source KG;
* ent_ids_2: ids for entities in target KG;
* triples_1: relation triples encoded by ids in source KG;
* triples_2: relation triples encoded by ids in target KG;
* rel_ids_1: relation ids in the source KG;
* rel_ids_2: relation ids in the target KG;
* time_id: time ids in the source KG and the target KG;
* ref_ent_ids: all aligned entity pairs, list of pairs like (e_s \t e_t);



## üî• Running

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eduzrh/AdaCoAgentEA.git
cd AdaCoAgentEA
```

2. Run the main experiment (without ablation)

The `retriever_document_path` refers to the KG2 which has deleted part of the information of the URL, leaving only the name.

```bash
python main.py --data DATASET
```
`DATASET` can be `icews_wiki`, `icews_yago`, `BETA` or any dataset you place in the directory [data](./data).

Note that the training set in the dataset is not used, i.e., no labelled data is used.


## üß™ Ablation Experiments

We provide various ablation settings to analyze the contribution of different components in our framework.

### Ablation Categories

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Ablation 1: Single Small Model-based Agent

Tests the combination of LLM Agents with a single small model-based Agent.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `S1` | Use only LLM Agents with small model-based Agent 1 |
| `S2`* | Use only LLM Agents with small model-based Agent 2 |
| `S3`* | Use only LLM Agents with small model-based Agent 3 |
| `S4`* | Use only LLM Agents with small model-based Agent 4 |

*Note: Options S2, S3, and S4 will cause the framework to fail because they lack necessary preconditions.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Ablation 2: LLM + Small Model-based Agent Combinations

Tests the combination of a single LLM with a single small model-based Agent.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `LLM1_S1` | Use only LLM1 and small model-based Agent 1 |
| `LLM2_S1` | Use only LLM2 and small model-based Agent 1 |
| `LLM3_S1` | Use only LLM3 and small model-based Agent 1 |
| `DomainExperts_S1` | Use only Domain Experts (LLM4) and small model-based Agent 1 |
| *and other combinations* | See code for complete list |

*Note: Combinations without S1 will cause the framework to fail because they lack necessary preconditions.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Ablation 3: Component Removal Analysis

Evaluates the importance of specific agents by removing them from the framework.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `no_LLM1` | Remove LLM1 agent |
| `no_LLM2` | Remove LLM2 agent |
| `no_LLM3` | Remove LLM3 agent |
| `no_DomainExperts` | Remove Domain Expert agents |
| `no_S1`* | Remove small model-based agent 1 |
| `no_S2` | Remove small model-based agent 2 |
| `no_S3` | Remove small model-based agent 3 |
| `no_S4` | Remove small model-based agent 4 |

*Note: The no_S1 option will cause the framework to fail because small model-based agent 1 is a necessary precondition.

### Example Commands

```bash
# Run Ablation 1 (using only S1)
python main.py --data icews_wiki --ablation1 S1

# Run Ablation 2 (using only LLM1 and Stage 1)
python main.py --data icews_wiki --ablation2 LLM1_S1

# Run Ablation 3 (remove LLM3)
python main.py --data icews_wiki --ablation3 no_LLM3
```

### Important Notes

1. Only one ablation category can be run at a time.
2. Certain configurations will cause the framework to fail as noted above.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors:

- **"Error: Only one ablation category can be selected at a time."**  
  Solution: Ensure you specify only one ablation experiment category parameter.

- **Data path errors**  
  Solution: Ensure data is placed in the correct location: `./AdaCoAgent/data/[data_name]`.
